## Description
This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze and predict trends in Indian stock markets. Using historical price data, the model forecasts short-term price movements to assist in data-driven decision-making. Designed to be modular and extensible, the project aims to incorporate real-time market data, visualizations, and performance evaluation metrics in future updates.

## Features
- LSTM-based prediction model for stock prices  
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Training, validation, and testing pipeline  
- Modular Python implementation for easy extensions  
- Intended future features:  
  - Real-time data integration  
  - Interactive web-based visualization of predictions  
  - Automated portfolio suggestions  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for experimentation)
